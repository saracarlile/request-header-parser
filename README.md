## Synopsis

This is a small HTTP request header parser using Node.JS and Express.

## Code Example

When you visit the project page, the result will display information about your HTTP request in JSON format.  Something like this: {"ipaddress"68.81.194.210"","language":"en-US","software":"Windows 10"}

This code could be used to help parse incoming HTTP requests.
